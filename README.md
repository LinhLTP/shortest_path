This project focuses on leveraging geospatial data to perform spatial analysis and route optimisation. The key goals of the project include:
1. Data Preprocessing: Loading, cleaning, and merging multiple geospatial datasets related to the UK and Copenhagen.
2. Spatial Visualisation: Generating interactive maps to visualise geospatial points, routes, and networks using tools like Leaflet and tmap.
3. Route Optimisation: Calculating the shortest paths between points of interest using routing algorithms and street networks.
4. Network Analysis: Analysing and visualising weighted street networks to facilitate travel-related insights and decision-making.
